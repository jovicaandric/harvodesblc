					</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">He is licensed by the Minnesota Board of Social Work as an LICSW and licensed by the Minnesota Board of Behavioral Health
						and Therapy as an LADC, LPCC with over 23 years in the fields of mental health and chemical health.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">The name of the Center, Harvodes was inspired by the loss of his cousin, Harvey and grandmother Odessa, who took the
						place of his biological mother at 6 weeks. The sudden death of his cousin Harvey was a loss that continues to impact
						his life to this day. Both deaths have their own uniqueness: his grandmother’s was expected, but his cousin’s was unexpected.
						While different, each death evoked similar feelings and emotions of: confusion, frustration, and anger all at once.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">Experiencing the deaths resulted in a process of grief, which included: Asking the questions such as why; challenging
						himself in terms of spirituality and inner strength; and learning how to best deal with the emotions. Both Odessa and
						Harvey had a tremendous impact on founder, Dr. Anderson, in their living years and following their deaths. The double
						impact led Dr. Anderson to search for a way to assist others who had experienced loss in a meaningful way to find hope
						for both the future and without their loved one(s). Harvey and Odessa helped shape the dream.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">Harvodes will "Assist people who want and need support as they experience their loss and find hope and new meaning in
						their life.”</p>
